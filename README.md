Deepser is a [help desk software](https://www.deepser.com/) and you can find more information in [Deepser API Docs](https://www.deepser.com/api/)

Installation
------------

This library can be found on [Packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/deepser/api-php).
The recommended way to install this is through [composer](http://getcomposer.org).
We support PHP >=7.0. This library is no longer tested on HHVM.

Run these commands to install composer, the library and its dependencies:

```bash
$ curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
$ php composer.phar require deepser/api-php^1.0.3
```

You then need to install **one** of the following:
```bash
$ php composer.phar update
```

Or edit `composer.json` and add:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "deepser/api-php": "^1.0.3"
    }
}
```
